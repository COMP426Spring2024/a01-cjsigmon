            <p>Once upon a time, Christopher Columbus was sailing the ocean blue.</p>
            <p>And he saw something he thought was a mermaid.</p>
            <p>Turns out it was a manatee, an animal the Portuguese would later call "o peixe boi".</p>
            <p>You may be saying, what? O peixi boi looks NOTHING like a mermaid! What was Columbus thinking?</p>
            <p>But let me remind you, this doofus thought the American continent was India.</p>
            <p>Let me give you five reasons to hate Columbus while I'm at it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>He was racist</li>
                <li>He was stupid</li>
                <li>He was a murderer</li>
                <li>He thought America was India</li>
                <li>He didn't even discover America. Loser.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>But back to peixe boi.</p>
            <p>Here is a cool picture of one.</p>
