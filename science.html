            <p>There are three main species of manatee</p>
            <ol>
                <li>West Indian Manatee</li>
                <li>The Amazonian Manatee</li>
                <li>The African Manatee</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The West Indian, aka the Florida manatee, is the best known to US residents. They are a well known habitant on the coast of - you guessed it - Florida.</p>
            <p>Their habitat ranges from the southern United States all the way down to the top of South America.</p>
            <p>The kind of thing a manatee looks for in a home is warmer water and a supply of food.</p>
            <p>Their preferred temperature range is from 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
            <p>Here is another cool picture of one.</p>
