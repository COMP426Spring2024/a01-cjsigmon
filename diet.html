            <p class="lead">Will peixe boi eat me alive?</p>
            <p>Sea cows are herbivores.</p>
            <p>Some plants that peixe boi likes to snack on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hydrilla</li>
                <li>Mangrove leaves</li>
                <li>Acorns</li>
                <li>Algae</li>
                <li>Manatee grass and turtle grass</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They feed on sea grass and other ocean vegetation; in fact, the Florida peixe boi feeds on more than 60 species of plants.</p>
            <p>Sea cows eat a lot. Around 32-108 pounds of food in a single day.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Their big appetites have even made persona non grata in some spots. For instance, the West African manatee has stolen so much from planted rice fields in Sierra Leone that they are considered pests in that country.</p>
            <p>Another interesting thing about the West African manatee, they are not complete herbivores; they have been known to occassionally snack on clams and fish.</p>
